<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I used to not activate location services on my phone because I thought that would conserve battery power. Lately, I've been leaving it on so I can have a log of everywhere I visit. I learned that you can retrieve all of your old location data from Google, so I wanted to see if there was any interesting trends I could suss out.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can download all of the data that Google has collected on you <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?utm_source=ob&amp;utm_campaign=takeout&amp;hl=en">here</a>. I checked off the Location History (JSON Format), which I downloaded as a .zip.</p>

<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<p>Following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30854697">an excellent post on StackExchange</a>, this is how I read in the location history datah:</p>

<p>Also following the post, I plotted a trajectory graph:</p>
{% highlight r %}
library(sp)
loc.sp = loc
coordinates(loc.sp) = ~lon+lat
proj4string(loc.sp) = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")

library(spacetime)
library(trajectories)
tr = Track(STIDF(geometry(loc.sp), loc.sp$time, loc.sp@data))
plot(tr)
{% endhighlight %}
<p><img src="/assets/r/LocationHistory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="400" /></p>
<p>I was intrigued by the inclusion of altitude information, so I wanted to see what a 3d plot would look like:</p>
{% highlight r %}library(scatterplot3d)
scatterplot3d(loc$lat, loc$lon, loc$altitude){% endhighlight %}
<p><img src="/assets/r/LocationHistory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="400" /> I didn't think it was super helpful....</p>
<p>From here, I decided on the first things I wanted to look at: what was going on when I was higher in altitude, and where were my most commonly visited places.</p>
<div id="high-altitude" class="section level3">
<h3>High Altitude</h3>
<p>I decided I would filter the location dataframe by when my altitude was greater than 500 and then plot those points against a map.</p>
{% highlight r %}highalt<-loc[which(loc$altitude&gt;500), ]

library(ggmap)
## Loading required package: ggplot2
map<-get_googlemap(center=c(lon=-80, lat=40), zoom=6, maptype="roadmap")
## Map from URL : http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=40,-80&amp;zoom=6&amp;size=640x640&amp;scale=2&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false
mapHighAlt<-ggmap(map)+geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, colour="red"), data=highalt)
mapHighAlt{% endhighlight %}
<p><img src="/assets/r/LocationHistory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="620" /></p>
{% highlight r %}#This is how to get the text addresses that correspond to the latitude/longitude coordinates. However, I'm not going to print them to slightly attempt to conserve my privacy :]
#highalt$textAddress <- mapply(FUN = function(lon, lat) revgeocode(c(lon, lat)), highalt$lon, highalt$lat)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>I know I've flown to Cleveland for school and then Cincinatti for work. It is interesting to see that I was high in altitude closer to home; I'm not sure what that exactly corresponds to. I've also flown to more places in recent memory, but probably left my phone off...</p>
<p>Weirdly, not sure what the random dot is above Virginia.</p>

<div id="most-frequent-locations" class="section level3">
<h3>Most Frequent Locations</h3>
<p>Based on the command below, looks like info has been collected since the end of 2013. I decided to use a frequency of 300 as a cutoff.</p>
{% highlight r %}min(loc$time)
## [1] "2013-11-05 08:21:56 EST"
{% endhighlight %}
<p>I used the count() function from plyr to check the frequency of coordinates being used:</p>
{% highlight r %}
library(plyr)
freq = count(loc, c('lon', 'lat'))
#Setting 300 as the cutoff:
highfreq=freq[which(freq$freq>300), ]

library(ggmap)
mapfreq&lt;-get_googlemap(center=c(lon=-76.5, lat=41), zoom=6, maptype="roadmap")
## Map from URL : http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=41,-76.5&amp;zoom=6&amp;size=640x640&amp;scale=2&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false
mapPoints <- ggmap(mapfreq)+geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = sqrt(freq), colour = sqrt(freq)), data=highfreq, alpha = .8)
mapPoints
{% endhighlight %}
<p><img src="/assets/r/LocationHistory_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="620" /></p>
{% highlight r %}#Not surprisingly, all of my most frequently visited locations corresponded to my alma mater, my family's home, and where I work.
#highfreqplaces <- mapply(FUN = function(lon, lat) revgeocode(c(lon, lat)), highfreq$loc.lon, highfreq$loc.lat)
{% endhighlight %}
