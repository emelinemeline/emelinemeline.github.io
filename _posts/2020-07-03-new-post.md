The last post I made on this site was on 15 February 2019.

The year is now 2020 and here is yet another post being added to the
internet on how things have changed; how things have not ended up where
we thought it would.

I remember I had a phase during which I was not so reticent to post my
thoughts online - I did spend quite a few of my formative years on GaiaOnline... 
which was an online hangout/social networking site with avatars and
a monetary system to buy clothing and whatnot for your avatar. 

Over the years, I've developed a paranoia about my words being taken 
the wrong way. I don't want to get into a debate with people I can't see.
I don't know the best way to defend myself against people who have never met me. 

But I plan to start sharing again, from this little corner. Maybe one day the internet 
will be archived and this website will be a datapoint in some study about 
digital trends in the early 21st century ðŸ¤”

I am yet another dumb, soft human being who thinks too much and has an 
infinite amount of progress to make. 
Here are my thoughts.
