I first learned how to code using Java in high school, switched to predominantly using Matlab in college, and then ended up learning R and Processing during my senior year.
I would categorize myself as a jack-of-some-trades and dedicated Googler more than a developer.

But I figured I should have a personal website, especially so I could share some of my Processing sketches. I don't remember how I ran across Github Pages, but it seemed like the best bet for a clean, minimal website with way more flexibilty,
which is great for my control freak tendencies.

Here are some of the resources that I used:

###Github Pages and Jekyll
 * [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) - This was great for learning how Github Pages works to start. 
 * [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) - I decided to migrate over to Poole
  because I'm really not super interested in HTML or CSS enough 
 * [Here's](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites) a list of a bunch of websites using Jekyll. All have their source code linked.
 * [How to point a domain on Google Domains to GitHub pages](http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/)
 * [Exerpts](http://antrikshy.com/blog/show-post-excerpts-on-poole-blog-homepage/)

###Processing.js
 * [Processing.js Quick Start - Processing Developer Edition](http://processingjs.org/articles/p5QuickStart.html)
 * [Source code for the Processing.js](websitehttps://github.com/processing-js/processing-js.github.io)
 * [Some notes on difficult to debug Processing.js errors](http://go.yuri.at/some-notes-on-difficult-to-debug-processing-js-errors/)
