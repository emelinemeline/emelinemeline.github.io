	<p>Hi! My name is Emeline.</p>
	<p>I'm currently a student at NYU Tandon, working towards a master's degree in computer science.</p>
	<p>This website runs off of Github Pages and Jekyll. 
	I'm using <a href="http://getpoole.com/">Poole</a> as a foundation for my website/blog.</p>
	<p>The source code for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/emelinemeline/emelinemeline.github.io">here.</a></p>
	<p>Check out my posts for some of my experimentation and musings. I mostly play around with <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> and R.</p>
	
	<p>Email me at emeline.liu at gmail.com.</p>
