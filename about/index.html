			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Emeline, which rhymes with 'line' and not 'leen.'</p>
			<p>I graduated with a BSE of Systems and Control Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 2015. Now I work as a data analyst/product modeler for <a href="http://www.fja-us.com/">FJA-US</a>, an insurance software company in NYC.</p>
			<p>I spend the rest of my time at Crossfit, commuting to and from New Jersey, and trying to teach myself things.</p>
			<p>This website is run with Github Pages, and my blog uses Jekyll.</p>
			<p>Check out my blog for some of my Processing experimentation and other assorted musings.</p>
