	<p>Hi! My name is Emeline Liu, which rhymes with 'line' and not 'leen.'</p>
	<p>I graduated with a BSE of Systems and Control Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 2015. Now I work as a data analyst/product modeler for <a href="http://www.fja-us.com/">FJA-US</a>, an insurance software company in NYC.</p>
	<p>I spend the rest of my time at Crossfit, commuting between NJ and Midtown, and trying to teach myself things. This website, which runs off of Github Pages and Jekyll, is my latest project.</p>
	<p>Check out my blog for some of my Processing experimentation and other assorted musings.</p>
