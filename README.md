This is Emeline Liu's personal website. Hosted by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com)

When I first started this website, I did not understand the concept of testing locally before pushing ðŸ˜°, so I would
commit anything just to see the update on the site. I understood git only to be
a mechanism by which I could put things somewhere else. I now am more organized about my code and 
my thoughts, but I admit I still do push haphazard commits to this site. 
I am aware the repo and history is not very clean.
I debated doing a cleanup but I have decided not to. I want the record.
